# Corporate-Classifieds
#### An organization has to create an Classifieds App for its employees to allow posting of ads on a particular product that the employees can buy and sell within the employee community. The employee who posts an offer in Classifieds Application is a seller and an employee who shows interest is a consumer. Though the real selling doesnâ€™t happen over the app, an engagement between the seller and the consumer is created, by liking/commenting to the offer.
